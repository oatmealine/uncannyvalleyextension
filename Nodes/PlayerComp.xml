[#PLAYERNAME#] how do i explain this
[#PLAYERNAME#] i was in a forest with mom because she forced me there like usual
[#PLAYERNAME#] and there was a bear there who attacked me once
[#PLAYERNAME#] instead of defending i just did a big fucking banshee scream, ran off and started trying to climb a tree
[#PLAYERNAME#] now you know me i cant climb anything
[#PLAYERNAME#] i fell right on the bear's head and ran away
[#PLAYERNAME#] i think he was knocked out because of that?? i didnt really look i was just running the fuck away
[Snarium] That... what
[Snarium] No really what the fuck
