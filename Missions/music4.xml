    <body>Hello, #PLAYERNAME#
You've been accepted in the group.
We will be contacting you shortly for newer instructions.

This is also the end of this extension's preview, so you can exit now. I guess.
There's no proper ending ATM so have this.
Give feedback in the Extensions Discord! -Fox</body>
